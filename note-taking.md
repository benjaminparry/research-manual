# Note-taking

## Shorthand

### Direct Quotes

Direct quotes are a word-for-word transcription of what the interviewee has said. Direct quotes are marked with double quotes.

Example:

“When reviewing notes after an interview I am sometimes uncertain which quotes are word-for-word from the interviewee.”

### Intent Quotes

Intent quotes are quotes that retain the intent of what the interviewee has said but slightly edited for {reasons}.

Example:

‘When I am taking notes during an interview I want to call out quotes that are what the interviewee said in essence but are not an exact transcription.’

Conditions for using intent quotes: If an interviewee in in two frames of mind and juggling between an anecdote and related details, you may wish to abstract the anecdote separately using an intent quote.

### Timestamps

Timestamps are time logs used during interviews to match notes to any recorded media with a timeline e.g. video or audio. Timestamps are marked in hour:minute:second (hh:mm:ss) format.

Example:

“I often have a direct quote written down but no reference or shortcut to the recording” 19:16:11

Timestamps can be created in various ways. My preferred method is to create them digitally in conjuction with note-taking using a text expander.

**Checklist Warning:** Ensure all individual recording devices are synced to the same time ahead of the interview.
