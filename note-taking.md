# Note-taking

## Shorthand

### Direct Quotes

Direct quotes are a word-for-word transcription of what the interviewee has said. Direct quotes are marked with double quotes.

`“”`

Example:

> *“When reviewing notes after an interview I am sometimes uncertain which quotes are word-for-word from the interviewee.”*

### Intent Quotes

Intent quotes are quotes that retain the intent of what the interviewee has said but slightly edited for {reasons}. Indirect quotes are marked with single quotes.

`‘’`

Example:

> *‘When I am taking notes during an interview I want to call out quotes that are what the interviewee said in essence but are not an exact transcription.’*

Using intent quotes: If an interviewee is in two frames of mind, juggling between an anecdote and related details, you may wish to abstract the anecdote separately using an intent quote.

### Timestamps

Timestamps are time logs used during interviews to match notes to any recorded media with a timeline e.g. video or audio. Timestamps are marked in hour:minute:second (hh:mm:ss) format.

`- 20:01:01`

Example:

> *“I often have a direct quote written down but no reference or shortcut to the recording” - 19:16:11*

Timestamps can be created in various ways. My preferred method is to create them digitally using a text expander, I use aText for Mac.

Checklist Warning: Ensure all individual recording devices are synced to the same time ahead of the interview.

Note: This format works well when you can match both timestamps and positions in the recording i.e. a video with a timestamp, but less helpful with audio recordings. To match timestamps to the positions in audio recording you could in theory use the audio file’s created/modified metadata.

 ### Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs are visual prompts added during note-taking to help the interviewer or note-taker return to interesting topics of interest later in the interview. Breadcrumbs are marked with 3 left guillemets.

` ««« {follow-up question}`

Example:

> Interviewees will briefly touch on a tangental topic that I want to return to later in the interview but I struggle to find where that is in my notes ««« What do you do currently to solve this?

Using breadcrumbs: Breadcrumbs should also include a follow-up question. Their consistent format makes them easily searchable when used with a digital note-taking format e.g. a text editor or Google Docs.

### Highlights

Highlights are visual prompts added during note-taking to immediately mark important parts of the conversation for review after the interview. Highlights are marked with 3 filled star symbols.

`★★★ {optional note}`

Example:

> Sometimes I uncover an important piece of information that may need to be included in the following interviews ★★★ Update discussion guide?

Using hightlights: Highlights are different to breadcrumbs in that they are the result of further questioning and used for points of discussion with your team after the interview.
